<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

KSNDMC twitter handle(@KarnatakaSNDMC) posts Major Reservoir data on a regular basis. This data is very helpful to in having a bird eye view of Major reservoirs in Karnataka.
However, the data is posted as a picture & does not provide the trend or the situation in a easy manner to understand.

This project is to present the data in a manner which conveys the trend & the situation at major reservoirs easily.
With D3 being one of the most prominent data visualization libraries out there, it was the natural choice for this project.
With me being a beginner in web development, the focus was to build this website with basic building blocks as much as possible.

Of course, no one visualization will convey all the information the data can provide since needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to advance to everyone who can report issue, suggest features or provide good old feedback & help me grow!

Just clone this repo to try starting something of your own.
